# Confluence Data Parser Vignette

This vignette provides a detailed walkthrough of the Confluence Data Parser module, explaining its purpose, configuration, and usage.

## Purpose

The Confluence Data Parser is designed to extract content from a specified Confluence space, which can later be used to build a RAG (Red Amber Green) system or any other applications as needed.

## Configuration

Configuration is essential to ensure the parser targets the correct Confluence space. 

- Copy the `config.template.yaml` from the root directory to `config.yaml`.
- Update the `base_url` parameter in `config.yaml` to your specific Confluence space URL.

## Usage

To execute the data parser:

```bash
python data_parser.py
```

Upon execution, the script will:

1. Crawl the specified Confluence space.
2. Follow links within the space.
3. Extract relevant data up to a defined depth.

## Limitations and Considerations

- The parser is tailored for basic HTML elements. Complex Confluence components or custom plugins might not be captured accurately.
- Ensure you possess the necessary permissions to crawl the Confluence space.
- Be considerate of the server's resources. Implement rate limiting or respect the `robots.txt` if available.
